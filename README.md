In this section, you'll find a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates my proficiency in data cleaning and exploration using pandas. This notebook showcases various techniques to clean and preprocess raw data, ensuring that it's ready for analysis.

You can access the Jupyter Notebook file [here](https://github.com/rml-lee/MYSQL-Tableau-SuperStore-Project/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20%26%20Exploration%20-%20Superstore.ipynb).


## Data Schema
After cleaning the data, this is our schema that will be used throughout this project.
