- The furniture department has earned a negative gross margin percentage four times throughout 2016. This is likely due to the pricing strategies implemented within this department.

- At the start of the second quarter, Office Supplies experienced the largest negative gross margin of the year but managed to recover significantly during the latter half of the year.

- The technology department has performed the best consistently reaching almost a 40% high in gross margin during October.

- Recommendations:

- Option 1: Re-evaluate pricing strategies for the Furniture department. Increase prices to better reflect the cost of goods sold and market value. 
- Option 2: Analyze and control the cost of goods sold by negotiating better terms with suppliers, finding alternative suppliers, or bulk purchasing. Improve operational efficiency by optimizing production processes, reducing waste, and implementing lean manufacturing practices.
